# Predictive-Modeling-Basic

Hi I'm Yoon, a data science enthusiast passionate about using data to solve real-world problems.
This repository contains:

- ðŸ“ƒ **Study notes** on theory and basic concepts about predictive modeling
- ðŸ““ **Practice notebooks** on modeling(basic)

## ðŸŽ“ Sections

### 1. Theory Notes
Detailed markdown notes based on the Predictive Analytics curriculum:
- Classification (Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes)
- Numeric Prediction & Logistic Regression
- Regularization (L1, L2, Elastic Net)
- Model Evaluation (Cross-Validation, Metrics)
- SVM (Classification & Regression)
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
- Neural Networks (DNN, CNN, RNN)
- Transformer & Attention Mechanism

### 2. Practice Code
Python notebooks implementing the above models:
- From scratch and with libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Structured like lab exercises or mini demos
